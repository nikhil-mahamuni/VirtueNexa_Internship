🕹️ Hangman - A Console-Based Python Game 🎯
Hii 👋👋 !! I created this console-based Python Hangman game
under the guidance of VirtueNexa as a Python Intern.

<!--🏁 How to Run the Game-->
Open the command prompt (cmd).
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the following command: <!--"python main.py" -->

<!-- 📝 How to Play -->
The game selects a random word from a predefined list.
The user is provided with a hint and blank spaces representing the hidden word.
The user can guess one letter at a time by entering it in the console.
If the guessed letter is correct, it fills in the blanks in the correct positions.
If the guessed letter is wrong, the number of remaining attempts decreases.
The game keeps track of all guessed letters and avoids duplicate inputs.
If the user guesses the word correctly within the allowed attempts, they win!
If all attempts are used without guessing the full word, the game ends with a failure message.
